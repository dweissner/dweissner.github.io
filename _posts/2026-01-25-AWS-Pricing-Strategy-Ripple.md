### INTRODUCTION
Pricing strategy has the power not only to influence sales for a product but to reshape an industry, industries that interact with that industry and even the entire economy. Pricing is the mechanism that determines who can afford to participate in an industry, how fast they can scale and what risks they inherently take. Amazon Web Services (AWS) illuminated this by replacing upfront capital and long-term hosting commitments with metered, on-demand pricing allowing businesses traded fixed expenses like data centers and physical servers for variable ones by using Amazon's infrastructure on-demand instead of acquiring their own.

The year 2000 commenced a decade when businesses sought to get on the web as the internet reshaped how people transact, communicate and exchange information.  Amazon Prime (2005) gave subscribers access to free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items and the iPhone (2007) dropped the internet into every hand. Facebook created new ways to network (2006) and Google created a platform for advertising (2000). The internet created needs where they didn't exist and businesses were beginning to harness digitalization for product development, marketing and new channels created by online shopping.

The problem was that for businesses to get onto the web before 2006, they needed to procure extensive computing infrastructure capable of storage, networking and general computing that cost thousands of dollars upfront and were thus out of reach for most businesses just trying to get off the ground. They also needed to forecast storage capacity and compute power needed for the future to secure sufficient server equipment or else risk being ill-prepared for surges and thus missing business opportunities. At the other extreme, overshooting compute needs led to computing infrastructure sitting idle. For firms in more seasonal industries like accounting, high intensity computing was integral but only needed for a few months every year, and for startups, budgets were tight and the future uncertain, so investments in servers and data centers carried a greater risk of capital gone to waste. 

Then there was the issue of scaling. Scaling up to accommodate growth before cloud computing meant purchasing more servers, infrastructure, equipment and related services via painfully slow procurement processes. Amazon redefined this equation in 2006 by making access and scalability`    instantaneous.



### DISRUPTION 
 AWS first released the S3 (Simple Storage service) in March 2006 and the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) shortly after. With just a credit card, developers could sign onto AWS and initiate a virtual server instance hosted by Amazon which was then charged back based on CPU, storage and bandwidth usage. Prices started at a base rate of 10 cents (USD) per hour for server time which if used continuously over an entire month would have added up to $72 and was comparable to what traditional server providers charged on a monthly basis at that time. It was even surmised [(in an article on TechCrunch at the time)](https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/24/exclusive-amazon-readies-utility-computing-service/) that the price may not have been sufficiently low to compete with traditional server providersat the time as it remained to be seen that the value of AWS was not in its continuously available monthly price but in offering an on-demand hourly rate along with the ease of launching and scaling the service.

</div>In their book <i>Game Changer,</i> Jean-Manuel Izaret and Arnab Sinha champion AWS strategy for its cost leadership approach likening it to that taken by low cost airlines like Ryanair and Southwest. These airlines reframed air travel as a commodity and took aim at consumers who were priced out by legacy carriers at the time. 


Similarly, with AWS Amazon commoditized computing services since a CPU is a CPU, and AWS made that CPU very accessible. By shifting to an on-demand hourly pricing model that facilitated easy scaling while keeping what the monthly cost would be level with the prevailing monthly rental price of dedicated hosting, AWS may have been taking aim at new markets like startups with tight budgets and small businesses which require agility to scale up or down. Mature enterprises on the other hand have much of that capital and operating infrastructure already financed and optimized which would have made switching to a cloud service provider less appealing initially. By lowering the entry barriers, AWS also shifted the purchasing decisions from being enterprise procurement-led to self-serve product-led, thus empowering developers to make agile decisions directly for their organization.


### AWS GROWTH & RIPPLE EFFECTS

AWS immediately saw great success with, over [12,000 developers signing up for S3 by the end of the day it was released](https://fortune.com/longform/amazon-web-services-ceo-adam-selipsky-cloud-computing/) and Amazon reported in their 2006 annual report that [over 240,000 developers worked with AWS by the end of the first year](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/2006AnnualReport.pdf). AWS's success had ripple effects across the economy. Startups no longer needed to raise gargantuan stashes of cash to buy servers and data center access to hit the ground running. As a Silicon Valley entrepreneur told [Wired,](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/mf-amazon/) "Infrastructure is the big guys' most powerful asset. This levels the playing field." The AWS Start-up Tour launched in 2008.

The 2008 AWS Start-Up Tour is set to take off September 3rd. We invite all start-up leaders and entrepreneurs to join us for these half-day events to learn how AWS empowers entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainable growth. Join us in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Boston, New York, Austin, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Seattle, Toronto, London, and Amsterdam.

The chart below from SiliconValleyIndicators.org shows that start-up growth saw impressive acceleration once the economy recovered from the 2008 financial crisis (see below).

In addition, cloud computing was a little known term before rapidly grew in popularity by the end of 2007 (see Google trends chart below).

Jeff Barr wrote in his [blog series](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/the-earliest-aws-customers-who-helped-build-the-cloud),

<div style="font-size: 0.75em;">

"It totally changed how people build businesses. You no longer needed to find tens of thousands of dollars to invest in hardware when you weren't even sure if something was going to work. It just de-risked everything. You could store all the data you needed on S3, and things that you couldn't have run on your personal computer before suddenly became doable. It completely transformed our understanding of what was possible."

Amazon was navigating uncharted waters in entering the tech space as an e-commerce conglomerate.
