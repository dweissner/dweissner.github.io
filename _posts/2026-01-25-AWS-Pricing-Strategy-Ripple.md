<h2>AWS</h2>
<ul> 
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Cloud Computing</li>
<li><strong>New or existing:</strong> Innovated an existing product</li>
<li><strong>Disruption:</strong> Drastically lowered costs, risks & barriers to entry of computing services by giving developers access on-demand via API.</li>
<li> <strong>Target Market:</strong> Developers, small businesses, startups</li>
<li> <strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> AWS had the $$$ infrastructure under Amazon to scale quickly, gain economies of scale which reduced their cost and then AWS passed those savings to customers via lower prices building a strong moat that warded off competition for many years.</li>

### INTRODUCTION
Pricing strategy has the power not only to influence sales for a product but to restructure an entire industry. Pricing is the mechanism that determines who can afford to participate in an industry, how fast they can scale and risks they inherently take, and altogether that can reshape the broader economy. Amazon Web Services illuminated this when it demolished the computing barriers that businesses faced by replacing the large server infrastructure model with cloud computing. Cloud computing allowed businesses to trade fixed expenses like data centers and physical servers for variable ones by only paying on-demand to use Amazon's infastructure instead of acquiring their own.

In the 2000's the internet began to reshape how people transact, communicate and exchange information.  Amazon Prime (2005) gave subscribers access to free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items and the iPhone (2007) dropped the internet into every hand. The internet was creating new needs where they didn't exist as Facebook created new ways to network and businesses sought to harness digitalization for product development, marketing and creating new channels with online shopping.

To transact over the web before 2006, businesses had to procure computing infrastructure and equipment costing thousands of dollars. They needed to forecast the amount of storage capacity and compute power they will need into the future so that they secured sufficient server equipment or risk being ill-prepared for surges and thus missing business opportunities. At the other extreme, overshooting compute needs led to computing infrastructure that sat idly waste. For firms in more seasonal industries like accounting, compute needs varied predictably over the year while for startups for which budgets were tight and the future was more uncertain, and thus carried a greater risk of capital gone to waste. 

Then there was the issue of scaling. Scaling up to accommodate growth before cloud computing meant purchasing more servers, infrastructure, equipment and related services via painfully slow procurement processes. Amazon redefined the equation in 2006. 



### DISRUPTION 
Amazon Web Services (est. 2006) changed this equation by restructuring the pricing basis to any amount available for purchase on-demand. Instead of having to forecast some amount for a future period,  firms could purchase the storage and computing power they needed from AWS for immediate use and then scale up or down moderated by their needs. Before AWS, if a product or service went viral, the firm would need to purchase or rent additional servers through a procurement process but with AWS, storage could be allocated via API. Thus, commenced the era of cloud computing (the "cloud" means someone else's computers).

 AWS released the S3 (Simple Storage service) in March 2006 and the EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) shortly thereafter. Developers could get rolling with a credit card and simply initiate a virtual server instance hosted with Amazon which was charged back based on CPU, storage and bandwidth usage. Rather than continuous term lengths, firms paid for their usage on-demand starting at a base rate of 10 cents (USD) per hour for server time which over a month of continuous use came to $72, comparable to traditional server providers at that time. It was even [surmised (an article in TechCrunch at the time)](https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/24/exclusive-amazon-readies-utility-computing-service/) that these prices may not have been sufficiently low to compete but the lure of the new model was not in its continuously available price but in the ease of launching and scaling it. 

> "Sometimes you need a lot of processing power, and sometimes you need just a little. Sometimes you need a lot, but you only need it for a limited amount of time. Perhaps you are doing some number crunching, some in-depth text processing, some scientific research, or your end-of-month accounting. Or perhaps you want to experiment with some radical new parallel processing algorithm for a week or two. In any of these situations, acquiring sufficient hardware to accommodate the high-water mark of your usage would definitely not be economical," [Jeff Barr, Amazon blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### Andy Jassy (first CEO of AWS), 
> “Amazon S3 is based on the idea that quality Internet-based storage should be taken for granted. It helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it.”


### AWS GROWTH & RIPPLE EFFECTS
AWS immediately saw great success. By the end of launch day, over 12,000 developers had signed up for S3 [1](https://fortune.com/longform/amazon-web-services-ceo-adam-selipsky-cloud-computing/S3)  and over 240,000 developers had worked with AWS by the end of the first year [2](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/2006AnnualReport.pdf). Amazon's success had ripple effect on other markets and industries. Startups could now get online with a credit card and pay a monthly bill for what they need instead of raising thousands to buy servers and access to data centers. Cloud computing became a key enabler of new business ventures as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur told Wired, "Infrastructure is the big guys' most powerful asset. This levels the playing field."[3](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/mf-amazon/). Had it not been for the financial crisis in 2007, we may have seen an immediate effect on startup growth but once he economy recovered, did see an acceleration (see below).

In addition, cloud computing was a little known term before rapidly grew in popularity by the end of 2007 (see Google trends chart below).

Jeff Barr wrote in his [blog series](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/the-earliest-aws-customers-who-helped-build-the-cloud),
> "It totally changed how people build businesses. You no longer needed to find tens of thousands of dollars to invest in hardware when you weren't even sure if something was going to work. It just de-risked everything. You could store all the data you needed on S3, and things that you couldn't have run on your personal computer before suddenly became doable. It completely transformed our understanding of what was possible."
