As I waved at the sales person and closed the door to begin my walk home from the store, I smiled with a sense of pride, but not more than ten steps in did this dissipate into crushing guilt.

I bought a pack of a paper for fifty dollars, and this was not Costco. I now am too ashamed to admit this. I am the type of person who chooses generic over brand wherever possible, and when shopping for services looks for areas in my neighborhood where the competition is high knowing I'll get the biggest bang for my buck there. 

I picked up a pack of watercolors thinking I might give painting a try but remembering that I had no paper at home, I simply asked "would you possibly have any paper to go with this?" The quiet, seemingly shy store owner looked over at the corner where a single pack of paper stood on a white shelf appearing as though a light were shining over it. He said, we actually have "Washi" paper." It is hand woven and well-designed; it very high quality and hard to find. 

Never have I valued a sheet of paper so highly as I did in that moment. Never have I thought for even a millisecond about the value of a sheet of paper until I stood in that store smiling at this shy man.
