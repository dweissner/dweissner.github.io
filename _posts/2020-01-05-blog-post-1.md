Life as is but in Spain
======

I went to Madrid on a whim. I stumbled onto one of those deals that are almost too good to be true and said why not continue to do everything I am doing except not in New York but in Madrid? One of the great things about working in a global role is that my actual time zone is irrelevant as long as the flow is such that everything is turned around within a day or so.
