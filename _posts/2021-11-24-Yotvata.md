On November 11th, I joined a group of friends and strangers (soon to become friends) for my very first multi-day hiking adventure in the Eilat Mountains of Israel. On November we started at Yotvata and camped on the ground right outside the trail. On Friday November 12th, we hiked Wadi Yotvata (Stats: 20km, 1000m ascent, 400m descent)

On Saturday, we hiked through the valley of the Timna. (Stats: 24Km 750m ascents, 1200m descents)
