Thoughts from my travels...

A few weeks ago, I traveled to Madrid on a whim. I decided why not continue to do everything I am doing except not in New York but in Madrid? One of the great things about working in a global role is that my actual time zone is irrelevant as long as the flow is such that everything is turned around within a day or so.

I fell in love with the lifestyle in Madrid.
