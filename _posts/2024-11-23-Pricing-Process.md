It's tempting in the heat of a negotiation after you've made your first pitch and set the price but the party comes back and vaguely asks for more so now you have several dials to turn but one shines brighter than all the others. As the "room" gets hot with  rising tension, you reach for the dial in the hopes of alleviating the pressure and hearing a resounding yes for reaching an agreement but to your surprise, the other party turns away leaving you hanging with your offer. 

But was it because of price? The price may not be the lever that needs pulling. I argue that it is cognitive laziness which often leads us into the pitfalls of believing it is. Often sellers go into a sales situation without undergoing the due diligence of analyzing the other side's value drivers and requirements. When the prospect rejects their proposition maybe because the competition has done the work and offered a more optimal solution, in a last ditch effort, they wiggle down the price in a brute force attempt to fit the misshapen piece into the puzzle. This might make sense in B2C situations like selling an overripe avocado or other static product, but most B2B situations are more complex with tailored solutions and contract terms, and thus more potential value drivers to align with price. Relationship building in B2B contexts can help identify those drivers so that when the time comes to set the ball of contracting in motion, more cards might be in play rather than just price. 

Using price as a default strategy can be a dangerous game not just for the business but for the entire market. See it as a sort of pinball machine of cascading effects whereby once the lever is pulled, there is the end customer's decision in that moment but also reactions of competitors, any trickle effect to other customers, a reduction in contribution margin and the associated impact on the business's cost drivers which may conflict with the very value drivers of higher paying customers. That sounds like a cannibalistic downward spiral.

In addition to identifying value drivers other than price to negotiate on, there are other considerations to consider when considering a price decrease:
* With lower prices diminishing the contribution per unit sold (price - variable cost), how many more units need to be sold to reach the same profit level as that attained at the higher price level before the change? In other words lowering the price effectively should raise the sales target. Sales targets should be defined within a framework of price ranges to be meaningful. Sales targets should be redefined as contribution targets. If a service costs 50 dollars to produce each time then selling it at 100 dollars yields 50 dollars in profit but selling it at 75 dollars only yields 25 dollars. Therefore 25 percent off the sales price diminishes 50 percent of the profit. 
* How will lower prices impact demand? Will demand rise sufficiently to meet higher profit level thresholds? 
* If demand is very elastic, then lowering prices may very well open the demand floodgates leading to higher profitability. 
* If demand is not so elastic, then the contribution loss from lowered prices may outweigh any sales gain. 
* How will lower prices impact the market for that service? How might it impact value perception for customers? 
* Will lowering the price lead to doubt of quality especially for those services which are opaque and difficult to judge quality on? 
* How will competitors react to lower prices? Will they react by lowering their own prices?
