It's tempting in the heat of a negotiation after you've made your first pitch and set the price but the party comes back and asks you to sharpen your pencils so now you have several dials to turn but one of those dials shines brighter than all the others. As the "room" gets increasingly hot with rising tension, you reach for the dial in the hopes of alleviating the pressure and hearing a resounding yes for reaching an agreement but to your surprise, the other party turns away leaving you hanging with your offer. 

But was it because the price? The price may not be the lever in need of pulling at all. 
I argue that it is often cognitive laziness which leads us into the pitfalls of believing it is. Often sellers go into a sales situation without undergoing the due diligence of analyzing the other side's value drivers and requirements. Then when the other side is frustrated by their proposition, they wiggle down the price in a brute force effort to fit the misshapen puzzle piece. 


Whether you are selling a service or an antique wooden chest on Facebook Marketplace, the price is not merely a number but a stake whose value you should be prepared to defend. 


A few months ago, I was hunting for a wooden chest to be both a statement piece and also a reading seat underneath my window on Facebook Marketplace.

Pricing is not a lever to be pushed and pulled with eyes closed. Pricing requires  strategic design to align with value drivers and within the context of an ongoing relationship. Pricing does not refer merely to a set of numbers but can rather be thought of as a sort of pinball machine of cascading effects once the lever is pulled with the end customer's decision in that moment being just one of them. 

A sales managers in pursuit of reaching a higher sales target may leap toward lowering the price of a product but without due diligence remains a set of relevant questions: 
* With lower prices diminishing the contribution per unit sold (price - variable cost), how many more units need to be sold to reach the same profit level as that attained at the higher price level before the change? In other words lowering the price effectively should raise the sales target. Sales targets should be defined within a framework of price ranges to be meaningful. Sales targets should be redefined as contribution targets. If a service costs 50 dollars to produce each time then selling it at 100 dollars yields 50 dollars in profit but selling it at 75 dollars only yields 25 dollars. Therefore 25 percent off the sales price diminishes 50 percent of the profit. 
* How will lower prices impact demand? Will demand rise sufficiently to meet higher profit level thresholds? 
* If demand is very elastic, then lowering prices may very well open the demand floodgates leading to higher profitability. 
* If demand is not so elastic, then the contribution loss from lowered prices may outweigh any sales gain. 
* How will lower prices impact the market for that service? How might it impact value perception for customers? 
* Will lowering the price lead to doubt of quality especially for those services which are opaque and difficult to judge quality on? 
* How will competitors react to lower prices? Will they react by lowering their own prices?
