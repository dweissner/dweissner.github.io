Pricing is not a lever to be pushed and pulled with our eyes closed but a strategy to be set from within the context of a system. Pricing does not refer merely to a set of numbers but rather is a sort of intricate pinball machine of cascading effects with the end customer being just one of them. 
A sales managers in pursuit of reaching a higher sales target may leap toward lowering the price of a product but without due diligence remains a set of relevant questions: 
* With lower prices diminishing the contribution per unit sold (price - variable cost), how many more units need to be sold to reach the same profit level as that attained at the higher price level before the change? In other words lowering the price effectively should raise the sales target. Sales targets should be defined within a framework of price ranges to be meaningful. Sales targets should be redefined as contribution targets. If a service costs $50 to produce each time then selling it at $100 yields $50 in profit but selling it at $75 only yields $25. Therefore 25% off the sales price diminishes 50% of the profit. 
* How will lower prices impact demand? Will demand rise sufficiently to meet higher profit level thresholds? 
* If demand is very elastic, then lowering prices may very well open the demand floodgates leading to higher profitability. 
* If demand is not so elastic, then the contribution loss from lowered prices may outweigh any sales gain. 
* How will lower prices impact the market for that service? How might it impact value perception for customers? 
* Will lowering the price lead to doubt of quality especially for those services which are opaque and difficult to judge quality on? 
* How will competitors react to lower prices? Will they react by lowering their own prices?
