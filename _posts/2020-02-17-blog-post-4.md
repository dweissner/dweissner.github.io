Photos taken and meditative thoughts I've had during recent bicycle rides.


Before moving to Tel Aviv, I had begun learning how to maintain my own bike. It makes the most sense that this be something that I do myself, but it certainly does require some technical knowledge and familiarity gained through experience.

I went for a ride through Westport Connecticut on my own today. It was beautiful. The town has a lot of character, and that  makes traveling through by bicycle all the more enjoyable.

Lunch ride to Italian restaurant called Gaia - the best Italian I've ever had and that is a mega tall order.

Finally got Aunt Fran to come out on her bike with me. Great family ride.

Eitan and I on our last ride together. It was nice to explore the Palisades for the first time.
