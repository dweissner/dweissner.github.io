Between 2005 and 2015, communication technology underwent a seismic shift. Faster data transfer, the rise of smartphones catalyzed by the iPhone’s 2007 release, and the rollout of LTE technology reshaped how we connect. These innovations not only changed how people communicated but also transformed how carriers structured and monetized their services. This essay focuses on one pivotal case: Verizon’s shift in pricing models.

### Old Model: Voice First 
Verizon’s earlier pricing model monetized primarily through voice minutes and text messages, with only limited options for data. Families purchased a bucket of minutes shared across lines, but each smartphone required its own separate data package within the plan. Tablets faced an even clumsier setup—customers had to sign separate agreements with their own price tiers, making multi-device connectivity costly and inconvenient. The result was a fragmented structure that discouraged households from adding devices and left Verizon exposed as WiFi offered a far simpler alternative.

### The 2012 Pivot
The <u>Share Everything</u> plan introduced by Verizon in 2012 changed all that by streamlining how we contract for cellular services. It replaced device-by-device pricing with a single, shared data pool - an overhaul that made multi-device connectivity far simpler. Verizon also moved beyond smartphones to allowing other internet-enabled devices like tablets and laptops to enroll in the same family plan as smartphone devices and also share in the data pool. By no longer requiring separate agreements for each device, the complexity of connecting new devices to the internet is greatly reduced. 


### More Devices, More Sticky
#### “The greatest subscription retention product in history is The Family Plan,” - Brian Norgard, former Chief Product Officer at Tinder
The ease of connecting more devices induced customers to connect more smartphones, tablets and other devices. This led to an expansion in the number of devices per household under the Verizon umbrella and increased overall market share. 

More devices on a plan also raises the switching costs. The more devices and individuals under a plan, the more cumbersome it is to change providers. This gave Verizon greater traction and price stickiness in the market for family plans. Group plans are structured so that margin is traded for massive reductions in churn. 


Furthermore, the new structure facilitated more differentiation on data usage.  To  illustrate, a Family Nationwide Unlimited Talk and Text Plan with four smartphones had a base price of \\$250 (\\$150 for 2 members plus \\$50 for each additional). If three members of the family use only 1GB of data per month and another has more intensive usage of 3GB every month, then they each would each need to add on an unlimited data package for \\$30 arriving at a data cost of \\$120 and a total plan cost of $370 under Nationwide. See the left side of chart 1 below. 

For a family that only requires 6GB of data, Share Everything changes that equation by allowing the family to scale back this data allotment to exactly the amount they need (6GB) in this case. Under Share Everything, each smartphone device pays an enrollment fee of $40 for unlimited voice and text for a base cost under the family plan of \\$160 for all four devices, and instead of purchasing a data package for each device, 6GB of data is purchased for the entire plan for \\$80 dollars and is shared by all four devices. This amounts to a total plan cost of \\$240, \\$130 less than under Nationwide, a substantial savings for consumers. See right side of chart 1 below.

    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px;">
      <p style="margin: 0;">Differentiating price on the amount of data and giving consumers the ability to pool data allows a family of four that uses 6GB of data in total and previously spent \$120 (\$30 per smartphone) on data with Nationwide to spend only \$80 on a data pool shared by all four devices under Share Everything.</p>

Not everyone would benefit from new price structure. For example, a family that used a high amount of data but voice and text more minimally, could end up paying more on a Share Everything than staying grandfathered on a Nationwide Family Plan that had an unlimited data package. 

Verizon rolled out the new plan at the time when consumers were switching from 3G networks to faster LTE networks which enabled them to tie the switch to shared data plans with the upgrade to better 4G LTE networks. The 4G LTE network was a remarkable improvement over 3G especially for speed and broadcasting video.  


### Realignment with revenue drivers
For cellular service providers, Verizon paved a new path to monetizing the growing reliance on data as web-based forms of communication became ever more ubiquitous. 
Before Share Everything, Verizon's price structure was out of alignment with the direction communication was taking as data-reliant forms were replacing traditional voice and text.  With tiered pricing for voice and text and a very low price set for unlimited data, Verizon was unable to capture the shift as revenues decreased from falling demand for voice and text.  at a time when people were shifting away from voice calls and text and toward services that rely on data. Under this structure, revenues from voice calls and text would decrease as revenues from data utilization would stagnate given the $30 for unlimited data.  


Savings and greater ease induced more consumers to buy smartphones and  tablets. Network effects along with growing speeds of communication led to even more data consumption as new forms of social media and other forms of communication expanded.

And if you think about the generations to come, video is going to become much more efficient to put through that network. So the initial LTE network is extremely efficient compared to 3G, but then when you get to 4G advance and then 5G ultimately the compression technology, the speed technology, video is going to be more consumption into the future. 

So we see that if you look at it we have about a third of our customers on shared, we have a third of our customers on LTE. And if you think about a third of that customer on LTE is consuming 64% of the data traffic in Verizon, you can imagine what that is in New York because that 64% is across the entire US.  

Adding tablets to a family plan made connecting to the internet far easier. By adding tablets onto established shared plans for \\$10 per month, Verizon eliminated the extra hurdle of having to navigate separate tablet pricing and establishing a new agreement as well as sales costs as mentioned on a Verizon shareholder call introducing the new plan. Inducing more customers to enroll their own phones and those of their family members as well as other devices creates even more reliance on Verizon which makes customers more price sticky and thus inelastic in the long run to avoid the cost of switching for everyone on the phone plan.
