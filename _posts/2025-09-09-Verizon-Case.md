Major changes in communication technology happened over the decade  2005-2015 that boosted speeds of data transfer and set in motion forces that altered how we communicate. An orchestration of innovation lends to this symphony of change with the introduction of smartphones and the iPhone's release in 2007, the advancement of LTE technology boosting internet data transfer and changes to how we contract and pay for these services which is the focus of this essay. 

Verizonâ€™s former pricing model focused monetization  on voice minutes and text messages and included options for data. A bucket of minutes was purchased and shared between lines on a plan. For smartphones, data was purchased for each device separately. Tablets could be connected to the internet through Verizon as well but not through the same plan. Instead separate agreements were created for each device with a range of data and price tiers to choose from thereby competing with the glorious ease of a WiFi-connection.  

In 2012, the Share Everything plan changed all that by streamlining how we contract for cellular services. Under the new structure, one bucket of data was purchased in one step and then shared between devices on the plan. It also moved beyond  phones to allowing other internet-enabled devices like tablets and laptops to enroll on the family plan and also share in the data pool. By no longer requiring separate agreements for each device, the complexity of connecting new devices to the internet was greatly reduced. These changes were associated with an uptick in smartphone and cellular-enabled tablets. Before 2010, most customers relied on carriers only for their phones but by 2014, over 22% of tablets sold were cellularly enabled. 

For Verizon the ease of connecting more devices to the family plan also led to an expansion in the number of devices under the Verizon umbrella and thus more market share. The more devices and individuals under a plan, the more cumbersome it would be to change providers and thus gave Verizon greater traction and price stickiness in the market for family plans. 

Furthermore, the new structure facilitates more differentiation on data usage.  To  illustrate, a Family Nationwide Share Talk and Text Plan with four smartphones had a base price of \\$250, and if three members of the family use only 1GB of data and another has more intensive usage of 3GB every month, then for each individual data would cost $30 entitling them to unlimited data for a total data cost of \\$120. That's a total cost of \\$370 for the plan under Nationwide. 

For a family that only requires 6GB of data, Share Everything changes that equation with a family plan base cost of \\$160 for the four devices, and then instead of purchasing data for each device, 6GB of data is added to the plan for \\$80 dollars and that 6GB is shared by all four devices resulting in a total of \\$240. See chart below.

For consumers the savings is huge. 
For cellular service providers, Verizon paved a new path to monetizing our growing reliance on data as web-based forms of communication became ever more ubiquitous. Savings and greater ease induced more consumers to switch to smartphones and tablets for the first time and then with network effects and growing speeds of communication, this led to even high volumes of data usage - which had now become Verizon's core service by reshaping how their service is monetized. Adding tablets to a family plan made connecting to the internet far easier. By adding tablets onto established shared plans for \\$10 per month, Verizon eliminated the extra hurdle of having to navigate separate tablet pricing and establishing a new agreement as well as sales costs as mentioned on a Verizon shareholder call introducing the new plan. Inducing more customers to enroll their own phones and those of their family members as well as other devices creates even more reliance on Verizon which makes customers more price sticky and thus inelastic in the long run to avoid the cost of switching for everyone on the phone plan.
