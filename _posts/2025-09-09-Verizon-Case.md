Between 2005 and 2015, communication technology underwent a seismic shift. Faster data transfer, the rise of smartphones catalyzed by the iPhone’s 2007 release, and the rollout of LTE technology reshaped how we connect. These innovations not only changed how people communicated but also transformed how carriers structured and monetized their services. This essay focuses on one pivotal case: Verizon’s shift in pricing models.

### Old Model: Voice First 
Verizon’s earlier pricing model monetized primarily through voice minutes and text messages, with only limited options for data. Families purchased a bucket of minutes shared across lines, but each smartphone required its own separate data package within the plan. Tablets faced an even clumsier setup—customers had to sign separate agreements with their own price tiers, making multi-device connectivity costly and inconvenient. The result was a fragmented structure that discouraged households from adding devices and left Verizon exposed as WiFi offered a far simpler alternative.

### The 2012 Pivot
The <u>Share Everything</u> plan introduced by Verizon in 2012 changed all that by streamlining how we contract for cellular services. It replaced device-by-device pricing with a single, shared data pool - an overhaul that made multi-device connectivity far simpler. Verizon also moved beyond smartphones to allowing other internet-enabled devices like tablets and laptops to enroll in the same family plan as smartphone devices and also share in the data pool. By no longer requiring separate agreements for each device, the complexity of connecting new devices to the internet is greatly reduced. 


### Families that Telekom Together, Stick Together 
### More Devices, More Sticky

The ease of connecting more devices induced customers to connect more smartphones, tablets and other devices. This led to an expansion in the number of devices per household under the Verizon umbrella and increased overall market share. 

More devices on a plan also raises switching costs. The more devices and individuals under a plan, the more cumbersome it is to change providers. This gave Verizon greater traction and price stickiness in the market for family plans. Group plans are structured so that margin is traded for massive reductions in churn.

### What's in it for me? 
For consumers, the new pricing structure facilitated optimization on actual data use. For consumers who relied heavily on voice and text but used data sparingly, this had the potential to generate a windfall in savings. 

To  illustrate, a Family Nationwide Unlimited Talk and Text Plan with four smartphones had a base price of \\$250 (\\$150 for 2 members plus \\$50 for each additional). If three members of the family use only 1GB of data per month and another has more intensive usage of 3GB every month, then they each would each need to add on an unlimited data package for \\$30 arriving at a data cost of \\$120 and a total plan cost of $370 under Nationwide. See the left side of chart 1 below. 

For a family that only requires 6GB of data, Share Everything changes that equation by allowing the family to scale back this data allotment to exactly the amount they need (6GB) in this case. Under Share Everything, each smartphone device pays an enrollment fee of $40 for unlimited voice and text for a base cost under the family plan of \\$160 for all four devices, and instead of purchasing a data package for each device, 6GB of data is purchased for the entire plan for \\$80 dollars and is shared by all four devices. This amounts to a total plan cost of \\$240, \\$130 less than under Nationwide, a substantial savings for consumers. See right side of chart 1 below.

    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 200px;">
      <p style="margin: 0;">Differentiating price on the amount of data and giving consumers the ability to pool data allows a family of four that uses 6GB of data in total and previously spent \$120 (\$30 per smartphone) on data with Nationwide to spend only \$80 on a data pool shared by all four devices under Share Everything.</p>

Not everyone benefited from the new price structure. For example, an individual that used a lot of data but relied much less on voice and text, could have ended up paying more on a Share Everything than staying grandfathered on a Nationwide Family Plan with an unlimited data package. 

An individual using 3GB of monthly data on an Individual Nationwide Talk and Text paid \\$60 for 450 voice minutes and unlimited domestic texting and \\$30 for unlimited data thus totaling \\$90. 
This produces a \\$20 savings over the \\$40 device fee + \\$70 3GB of data, a total of \\$110.  See diagram below.

### Realignment with key revenue drivers
For cellular service providers, Verizon paved a new path to monetizing the growing reliance on data as web-based forms of communication became ever more ubiquitous. Verizon's previous price structure had fallen out of alignment with emerging trends. While voice and text revenues previously ratcheted up the bulk of revenues for telecoms, declining utilization were leading consumers to lower price tiers. With the \\$30 price tag for unlimited data under Nationwide, Verizon had unwisely capped its own revenues at a time when the sands were shifting and IOT was continuing to give new forms to communication and knowledge sharing. Verizon could not effectively capture the shift toward data utilization as revenues declined from falling demand for voice and text. 

Doing away with unlimited data plans and increasing price differentiation on data usage at a time when data consumption was on the rise allowed Verizon to more effectively monetize soaring data usage.  


Verizon rolled out the new plan at a time when consumers were switching from 3G networks to faster LTE networks. This created an opportunity for Verizon to tie the switch to shared data plans with the upgrade to better 4G LTE networks. The 4G LTE network was a remarkable improvement over 3G especially for speed and broadcasting video.  


Savings and greater ease induced more consumers to buy smartphones and  tablets. Network effects along with growing speeds of communication led to even more data consumption as new forms of social media and other forms of communication expanded.

And if you think about the generations to come, video is going to become much more efficient to put through that network. So the initial LTE network is extremely efficient compared to 3G, but then when you get to 4G advance and then 5G ultimately the compression technology, the speed technology, video is going to be more consumption into the future. 

So we see that if you look at it we have about a third of our customers on shared, we have a third of our customers on LTE. And if you think about a third of that customer on LTE is consuming 64% of the data traffic in Verizon, you can imagine what that is in New York because that 64% is across the entire US.  

Adding tablets to a family plan made connecting to the internet far easier. By adding tablets onto established shared plans for \\$10 per month, Verizon eliminated the extra hurdle of having to navigate separate tablet pricing and establishing a new agreement as well as sales costs as mentioned on a Verizon shareholder call introducing the new plan. Inducing more customers to enroll their own phones and those of their family members as well as other devices creates even more reliance on Verizon which makes customers more price sticky and thus inelastic in the long run to avoid the cost of switching for everyone on the phone plan.
