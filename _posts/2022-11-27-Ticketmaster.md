testing change
On Thursday, November 11th, 2021 I joined a group of friends and strangers (soon to become friends) at the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station to embark on what was my first multi-day hiking adventure. Our bus dropped us off right at Yotvata which is just a few miles from Eilat in the Negev desert of Israel and there we camped on the ground right outside the trail. On Friday November 12th, we hiked Wadi Yotvata (Stats: 20km, 1000m ascent, 400m descent)

On Saturday, we hiked through the valley of the Timna. (Stats: 24Km 750m ascents, 1200m descents)
