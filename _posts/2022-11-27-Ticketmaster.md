Over this past week, Ticketmaster made headlines for mishandling ticket sales for an upcoming Taylor Swift tour. With all the griping at Ticketmaster about prices and monopolization, it was easy to lose sight of the big picture.  

Mainly, tickets went on sale on Tuesday, November 15th, and people all over the U.S. were queued up to purchase their share but it turned out that demand was higher than Ticketmaster's systems could handle. As fans signed on and called in only to wait on virtual queues often behind thousands, Ticketmaster systems were unable to hand the load with many receiving error messages and being kicked out of the queuing system altogether. 

Joining the vocal backlash of disappointed fans, Taylor Swift made the following  statement on November 18th, “I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could.”

Why would Ticketmaster allow this to happen? Why wouldn't they have taken measures to mitigate the risk of system overload for one of the highest grossing artists of the age? Some might attribute it to market power giving Ticketmaster the slack to spend less on system efficiency. Why should they fear losing the business of angry fans and stakeholders if there is no other player in the market? 

In 2010, the US Justice Department (DOJ) approved a merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation giving birth to the colossal Live Nation Entertainment. Live Nation Entertainment now owns both the largest primary ticket seller and the largest promoter. A promoter team contracts directly with the band or artist and is responsible for securing venues, advertising, transportation and other touring needs. Since primary ticket sellers like Ticketmaster contract with venues and venues benefit from access to tours with high grossing artists, a promoter and primary ticket sales partnership might raise incentives of coercing venues to work exclusively with Ticketmaster in order to gain access to the promoter's set of tours. Furthermore, Ticketmaster-venue partnerships are often secured through exclusive, multi-year contracts which may point to some form of coersion. 

In a 2010 report, the DOJ estimated that Ticketmaster held at least 80 percent of market share in 2008 (Competitive Impact Statement, United States of America v. Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc., No. 1:10-cv-00139 (D.D.C. Jan. 25, 2010)). 

***Is 80% market share enough to constitute a monopoly?***
On their website, the FTC states that when making conclusions about a firm's conduct, they look at whether the firm has significant and durable market power to raise price or exclude competitors but if the estimtate of market share is less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a geographic area, then the firm is usually deemed not to have monopoly power. 

**Monopolies are not inherently bad though.**
A monopoly is not a concern when obtained by having superior and innovative products or service. It becomes a problem when that dominance is achieved through predatory means, or when unfair advantage grants the firm the ability to penalize consumers through unethically high prices and exclusionary practices. 

Part of Ticketmaster's market power can be attributed to how the primary ticketing business is structured. In the ticketing business, high startup costs create **barriers to entry** for potential competitors. Having venues typically sign *long-term, exclusive contracts* could  also discourage new entrants into primary ticketing in a seemingly saturated market. 

**What is bad is when a monopoly gives a firm unfair advantage over not only consumers but also other businesses**
Market power can give a firm sway over negotiations with key stakeholders. Below is a flow chart illustrating how the three key players in the primary ticketing game interact. One can easily conclude that Live Nation has a profitability incentive to either give preferential treatment to venues that contract with Ticketmaster or employ exclusionary tactics to harm venues that do not.

#### The Bottom Line
**What does this have to do with Taylor Swift?**
The main problems for Swifties are (1) Ticketmaster pre-sale fiasco and (2) high ticket prices. 

Market power may have led Ticketmaster to underinvest in site stability resulting in lackluster service. Had it faced credible competition it may not have taken the consumer experience for granted. 

High ticket prices can arise naturally via market forces of supply and demand and with the markup on ticket prices seen in the secondary market, it could even be that the face value initially set for the primary market is lower than that actual market clearing price. Another way for ticket sellers to extract revenue is through add-on fees like drip pricing mechanisms whereby add-on costs are revealed in the finalization stages of a transaction when consumers are least likely to make comparisons and weigh their decision.
