Thoughts from my travels...

My cousin Andy from South Africa was being honored in a summit in Montreal that was sponsored by Barclays featuring 20 leaders in finance and accounting from around the world. Andy asked if I'd like to drive up to Montreal from New York for a long weekend. These pictures are from that trip.

This is the first and also the simplest street art I found here in Montreal and as sparing as it is, it touched me the most:

The excitement of meeting new people. Four people from completely different places and backgrounds came together for a night out in Montreal and it was beautiful:

Street art here is amazing:
