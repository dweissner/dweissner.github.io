Purpose of this page
------
This is to be a place beyond scrappy notebooks and OneNote tabs to aggregate what I see, read and experience into more thoughtful applications and further reinforce the scaffolding from those knowledge streams. I will also use this space to write reviews on books and other content related to pricing, or related streams, that I am currently reading. 

I particularly enjoy thinking about the intersection between pricing, economics and psychology. I tend to approach pricing as a puzzle. A quote about mathematics by Andrew Wiles applies well to pricing: 
>|"Perhaps I could best describe my experience of \[pricing] in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, youf find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly, it's all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you enter the next dark room..." 

My notes here will not contain any information or learnings from my place of employment.
